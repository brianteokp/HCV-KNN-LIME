 Questions:
Using KNN to predict disease progression based on biomarkers from hepatic panels.

Project learning outcomes:
1. Analyze, wrangle and clean data.
2. Carry out hyperparameter optimization on cross validation set. (elbow plot method)
3. Utilize optimized hyperparameter to predict based on test set.
4. Carry out LIME analysis for model explanation (WIP)

Outputs:
Note: All blood donor and suspected case data removed.
1 = Hepatitis
2 = Fibrosis
3 = Cirrhosis

Hepatitis C virus is the causative agent of Hepatitis C, which can lead to chronic inflammation, with increased damage leading to excessive tissue remodelling as observed in fibrosis.
Further accumulation of such scarring results in severe scarring of the liver and greatly reduced liver function (cirrhosis).

Therapeutic interventions largely involve antiviral regimens, and are effectively controlled in most chronic cases.
The regimen differs depending on HCV genotype and presence and absence of cirrhosis, which can also determine the necessity of liver transplantation.
Since progressive fibrosis is the major cause of morbidity in chronic liver diseases, it is imperative that prognostic markers must be identified that can predict disease progression,
such that therapeutic interventions can begin early.
